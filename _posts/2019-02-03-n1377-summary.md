# Summation & Review about N1377

### What is move semantic
* mostly about performance optimization
* ability to move an expensive object from one adress in memory to another, while pilfering resources of source in order to construct the target with minimum exchange.
* [Copy constructor elsion] - existed move semantics before this proposal

Uniform syntax and semantics is needed to enable generic code to move arbitrary objects
